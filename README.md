# Dotfiles

Welcome!

Here are my dotfiles.

If you would like to use them go line by line through `install-packages.sh` file, read comments and run commands.


Please do not use these files blindly! Read and use only what you really really want. Winter will come if you ignore these warnings intentionally.

If you really know what you are doing, stow is ready for you to use.

Good luck!

PS

From time to time you want to update your environment to more up to date. `update-packages.sh` is your friend then.

# A rationale behind this setup

Most important thing for me is an ability to quickly search for 3 things: files, content of a file and commands.

|  Fast search  |      Terminal       |  Vim   |
|---------------|---------------------|--------|
| Files         | CTRL+T              | :Files |
|               | fzf --preview       | CTRL+P |
|               | z                   |        |
| Files Content | rg                  | :Rg    |
| Commands      | CTRL+R              |        |
|               | CTRL+S              |        |
|               | zsh-autosuggestions |        |

# Todo
1. Change vundle to vimplug or internal plugin manager from modern Vim.
3. Add: sudo apt-get install ruby-full (for highlight in fzf in vim).
3. Add fzf installation from vim.
4. Keep custom vim fzf configuration from vim.
